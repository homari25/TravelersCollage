                    <p>Traveler's Collage" started in 2010 when I was accepted into an exchange program to study at a university in the Netherlands. 
                        As someone from a country surrounded by the sea, one of the most exciting things was to travel to another country by road trip. 
                        At the time, I was a student with no money to buy a good camera, and although I wanted to invite my family during my stay, my mother was unable to come due to a serious illness. 
                        So, I decided to collect bits and pieces of every city I visited.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Over the past 13 years, my collection has grown to include over 120 cities in 30 countries, and it continues to grow today.
                        During the process of documenting these cities, I became curious about how outsiders could understand the culture of exotic places from a local's perspective.
                        The 2022 version of Traveler's Collage is a handmade digital collage that provides a platform for people to experience virtual travel through my eyes. 
                        For this digital version, I have archived 10 cities from around the world that have inspired, surprised, and influenced me in my life.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        If you flip through the collage, you will see how different each city can be in terms of color, typography, usage of photography, and more. Just like I did, you will realize that these differences add up to shape the uniqueness of each city.</p>
