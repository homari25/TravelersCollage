            <div class = "paragraph">“Saigon… it’s a place where rains suddenly.” It now has become a city full of energy and heat, with all the noise of bikes and people chattering in the market.  Ho Chi Minh City is a city that experienced rapid economic growt after the Vietnam War in 1975. There is no longer a hint of the war. Instead, it is now a bustling city with fashionable spots that remind visitors of Paris. At the same time, the Vietnamese traditional crafts still keeps its Asian intricate aesthetics. Ho Chi Minh City has both influences of Chinese and Western cultures, both elaborated in an elegant way.</div>

                                The legacy of the Vietnam War that ended in 1975. It’s shocking how people lived in such an extensive and small caves for years...

                                Because it is geographically close, Vietnamese culture and cuisine are deeply affected by Chinese. I’ve been to many Chinese restaurants around the city.

                                It is a typical morning scene of Ho Chi Minh City that high school girls go to school wearing ao dai, as ao dai is a school uniform to them.

                                I landed in Ho Chi Minh City the first time when I was 6. Looking down from the airplane, the city was filled with city lights in darkness. I remember I told my mom, “Look, we’re above the sky and now we’re in the space!”
