            <div class = "paragraph">Dubai is the capital city of the United Arab Emirates. It is a city of oil money, wealth and futuristic skyscrapers, just one hour away from Abu Dhabi. It is the center of economy and tourism of the Middle East. There are so many luxurious objects that is very far from my ordinary life, such as Burj Khalifa, the tallest building in the world, the vending machine of gold. It seems there are many immigrants from Pakistan and Saudi Arabia.</div>
