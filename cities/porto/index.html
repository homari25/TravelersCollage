            <div class = paragraph>Porto, the second largest city in Portugal. Unlike the Netherlands, which has no ups and downs, Porto has a lot of steep hills. The city is surrounded by the ocean and hills, reminding me of Kiki’s Delivery Service. There are many old architecture, which some of them built in the 12th century,  with Catholic influence, such as Igreja dos Clérigos and The Cathedral. The streetcar is made of wood and has a retro vibe. Houses that are built tightly next to each other look more like ones in Amsterdam, but the orange roofs, bricks and balconies do not look like ones in European style. </div>

                            In porto, even though iti s a small town, there are subways, tram cars and ropeways that navigate residents and tourists to go around the city.

                    A baroque church with 75-meter tall bell tower. Definitely the most charasteristic symbol of Porto.

                    In the map, it may look just a port town facing the sea. However, once you get there, you’ll be shocked that how there are so many steep hills going upward to the mountaineous area.
