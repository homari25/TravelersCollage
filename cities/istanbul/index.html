            <div class = paragraph>Turkey, where is located in between the oriental and the western world. Istanbul is a beautiful coastal city with a blend of influences from Muslim and Christianity. The beauty comes not only from its world heritage architecture such as Aya Sofia, but also from exotic scent of spice from markets and cuisine that attracts people through five senses. Definitely one of the cities I’d like to live in the future.</div>
